# Script Lab

This is where I try out all of my newly-learned Javascript scripts & libraries! <br/>
I am using <strong>Rails 6 with Webpacker (4.0)</strong> (instead of the usual asset pipeline).

## What's in the bag?
- Bootstrap 5
- jQuery
- Intersection observers (to implement soon)
- .. more to come!
