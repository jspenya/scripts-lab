# Penyakamaayo's Scripts Lab
###### A frustrated web developer's scripts lab
<br/>
This is where I try out all of my newly-learned Javascript scripts & libraries! <br/>
I am using <strong>Rails 6 with Webpacker (4.0)</strong> (instead of the usual asset pipeline).

## What's in the bag?
- Bootstrap 5
- jQuery
- Stimulus JS
- Lazy loading images (using loading="lazy" attribute)
- Intersection observers (to implement soon)
- Devise
- Like feature using AJAX
- Facebook Messenger Bot Implementation (No gems // well, only the HTTP gem for api requests)
- Channels/Chatrooms *Live* with ActionCable (on-going development)
- Scheduling App (on-going development)
- Polymorphic Comments to Meetings (Scheduling App model)
- Facebook Messenger Chat API hooks to Arduino
